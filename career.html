<h1> My Experience </h1>
<h2> Laboratories </h2>
<h3> Freedman Lab </h3>
		<p> As a soil science lab, the Freedman Lab specialized in microbiomes and the organisms that reside within them. As such, I learned many DNA analysis techniques, PCR being prime among them. </p>
<h3> Lewis Lab </h3>
		<p> At the Lewis Lab, I expanded further on my DNA knowledge. As a Genetics lab, the specifics of histone and RNA interactions were further explored and I was exposed to many techniques that dealt with this.</p>
